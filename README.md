# Maintenance Status

## Upstream Status

This project was originally marked as abandoned by its maintainer due to
lack of time and interest. The original author encouraged others to fork
and continue maintenance if interested.

## Maintenance Status (This Repository)

This repository is a community-maintained continuation of the original
Letterpress project.

The goal of this fork is to:
- Keep the project buildable and usable
- Fix bugs and compatibility issues
- Accept community contributions
- Preserve the original vision and GPL licensing

This is an independent fork and is **not officially maintained by GNOME**
or the original author.
